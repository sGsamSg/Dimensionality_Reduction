# Dimensionality_Reduction
 ### An example of dimensionality reduction techniques on MNIST dataset

An ML notebook on MNIST dataset. This notebook primarily focuses showcasing the usefulness of dimensioanlity reduction techniques for reducing learning time for models and 2D visualizaton. It also shows how two seperate techniques can be stacked to reach a better conclusion. Some of the techniques used includes Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, Locally Linear Embedding, Multidimensional Scaling, Linear Discriminant Analysis.
